# Student Depression Dataset Analysis

## 📌 1. Introduction
Briefly describe:
 
 - Purpose of the analysis
 - Source of the dataset
 - Goal: insights + prediction model

“This project analyzes student mental health using the Student Depression Dataset, focusing on lifestyle, academic, and emotional factors. The objective is to identify patterns and build a model to predict depression risk.”

## 🧼 2. Data Cleaning
Includes:
 - Inspecting data types, nulls, duplicates
 - Handling missing values (mode/median strategy)
 - Handling outliers (IQR method)

## 🔤 3. Encoding Categorical Variables
 - Label encoding for binary columns
 - One-hot encoding for multi-class features
 - Encoding the target variable (Depressed vs. Not Depressed)

## 📊 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Use visualizations to analyze:
 - Depression distribution
 - Gender, sleep, academic workload vs depression
 - Correlation matrix (heatmap)
 - Bar plots, box plots, histograms
   
## 📌 5. Key Insights
 - Summarize key takeaways from your EDA
 - Highlight strongest correlates with depression
 - Mention any surprises or patterns

## 🤖 6. Prediction Model
 - Feature selection
 - Train-test split
 - Model building (start with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
 - Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## 📈 7. Conclusion
 - Reflect on the findings
 - Potential real-world use
 - Limitations and future work
